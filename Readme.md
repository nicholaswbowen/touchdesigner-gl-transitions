# TouchDesigner-Transitions

### A robust library of transitions between two textures.

These .tox files contain components that each implement a shader from the gl-transitions project, ported for Touchdesigner. There is a ton of variety, and these make it easy to add effects when you switch between textures in your installation. 

### Getting Started

You can pick up the tox files by downloading them from the [releases page](https://github.com/nicholaswbowen/touchdesigner-gl-transitions/releases)  and drag the tox files in individully or add them to your palette.

Every transition has a parameter called progress that fades the effect from a to b, and many have additional ones, depending on the effect.
